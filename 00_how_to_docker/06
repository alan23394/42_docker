# 06. Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task.
# It should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80
# port attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container
# functions properly by visiting http://$(docker ip Char):5000 on your web
# browser.

# Resources:

docker run -d --name overlord --restart=always -p 5000:80 nginx
