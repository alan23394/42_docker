# 12. Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to
# restart on its own in case of error, and the root password of the database
# should be Kerrigan. You will also make sure that the database is stored in
# the hatchery volume, that the container directly creates a database named
# zerglings, and that the container itself is named spawning-pool.
